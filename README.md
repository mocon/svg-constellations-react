## Development

yarn start
```

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing

```
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```
CI=true yarn test
```

Runs the tests once, without interactive mode.

## Build for production

```
yarn build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
