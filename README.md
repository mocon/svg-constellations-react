# SVG Constellations with React

A `create-react-app` with Scss, used to render `<svg>` constellations over a `canvas` sky.

## Installation

```
yarn
```

## Development

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing

```
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```
CI=true yarn test
```

Runs the tests once, without interactive mode.

## Build for production

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Note, if the `build` folder does not exist already, create it before running this command.

## Deploy to Github Pages

```
yarn run deploy
```

## Clean

```
yarn run clean
```

Deletes the `node_modules` directory, cleans the Yarn cache, and reinstalls the dependencies.
